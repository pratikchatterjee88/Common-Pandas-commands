# Common-Pandas-commands

These are the few of the common pandas techniques for slicing and dicing the data frame.

Few of the commands used are:
  -  Reading the data
  -  Filtering: slicing data
  -  Saving data: Saving into different formats
  -  Creating a new column: creating a calculated columns
  -  Group by: This function is used to do some filtering based on the group by like we do in SQL
  -  Melting: It works same as grouping
  -  Unstacking and Stacking:
  -  Pivot tables: Same as excel we can use the pivot table function to create a pivot table.
  -  Chunking : This is used when we have a huge dataset and reading it in one shot will take a lot of time. We break the data into chucks of rows and the dataset is read accordingly.
